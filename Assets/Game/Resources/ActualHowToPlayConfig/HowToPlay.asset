  Text: "Click only on the balloons that are selected for you \u2014 clicking on
    others will lead to failure. For each correct balloon, you earn a certain number
    of points. Points are converted into coins, which you can use to purchase other
    balloons. Each level requires more points to complete, but also becomes more
    difficult. The number of stars you earn depends on how many points you collect
    out of the maximum possible."
